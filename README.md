# Stellar Classification

Second project for ITCS - 3162: Intro to Data Mining. I worked through the process of obtaining data, preprocessing data, visualization, modeling, and evaluation. The models in the notebook file include Decision Tree and Random Forest, with classification metrics such as confusion matrix, classification reports, and cross validation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle and was put together by the Sloan Digital Sky Survery. It can found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17
